# Algorithms with Go

This is a repository I am using while following Jon Calhoun's *Algorithms with Go* course, which is freely available. I am evaluating it as a student to determine whether to recommend it to my junior engineers or students.

## Approach

My approach is simple. I am viewing the start of each video, writing the alogrithm as I would without the video, and then comparing my output to that of the video. I may make some changes after watching the video's solution, but in general I will try to leave my own solutions in place.
